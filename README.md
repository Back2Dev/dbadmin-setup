# Dbadmin setup

A Command line utility to set up dbadmin

TODO: Provide a link to dbadmin documentation

## Why?

Because I write useful code (at least for me), and want to install it in all of my environments

## Getting started

You don't need to install this to your project, in fact it's easier not too, just use npx, as it checks for the latest version and will always use that

```
cd <your-meteor-project>
npx dbadmin-setup collections .   # Generates collections code for dbadmin
```

# Available Commands

| Command     | Purpose        |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| collections | generates code |

# Development

## Running the tests

Testing is quite simple atm. Feel free to add test cases, particularly if something is broken.

```
npm run test
```

## Deployment

No need, this is a dev time tool. You don't even need to add it to your project
