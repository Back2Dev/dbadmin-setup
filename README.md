# Ask Mike

A Command line utility to set up dbadmin 

## Why?

Because I write useful code (at least for me), and want to install it in all of my environments

## Getting started

```
npm install -g dbadmin-setup  # Install globally, not to the project
dbadmin-setup collections   # Generates code for dbadmin
```

# Available Commands

| Command  | Purpose                                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| collections       | generates code |


# Development

## Running the tests

Testing is quite simple atm. Feel free to add test cases, particularly if something is broken.

```
npm run test
```

## Deployment

No need, this is a dev time tool. You don't even need to add it to your project
